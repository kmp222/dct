# Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Comparison

This project aims to implement the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) from scratch in C++ and compare its performance with established libraries such as FFTW. Additionally, we provide a Python implementation from scratch and compare it with the Scipy library's DCT implementation.
